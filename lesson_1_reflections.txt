Learned some new unix commands.
Diff allows me to compare two plain text files.
I decided to use Sublime a plain text editor.
I can open from command line by 'subl'.

Comparing the differences in two versions pinpoint any changes.
(aka errors).

Looking at mistakes from old or new versions could prevent a programmer
from making them again and again.

Pros and cons of manual commits:
	Pros- You can ensure each commit has meaning and will run.
	cons- You may forget to commit.

Saving multiple files in one commit is more valuable for programming.
Google docs only saves documents and spreadsheets that lack interdependence.

git clone directly into the directory you want. 
Then make sure you are in that directory before running git commands.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	Version control would allow you to avoid any irreversible changes.

	There is no worry that you will not remember exactly what you had previously.

Now that you have workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	I have no projects in mind at this time. I can use it for the ML udacity course.
